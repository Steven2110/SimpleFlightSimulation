# SimpleFlightSimulation
Simple flight simulation is laboratory assignment № 1 simulation (имитационное моделирование). In this project we are simulating ball projectile using the parabolic equation on two different condition:

1. Without Atmosphere (neglecting all other parameter that affects the flight path, using universal projectile motion equation) 
2. With Atmosphere (taking into account air resistance, object weight)
